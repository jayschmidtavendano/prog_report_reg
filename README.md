### Introduction
My name is **Jason R. Schmidt Avendaño**. This is a data report of a study that aimed to look at the research question; Do individuals with large spelling ability, have shorter gaze duration for low frequency words than individuals who have small spelling ability? 

### Variables 
   - Subject: Unique participant ID
   - High: The gaze duration for words that are commonly appearing in the English Language 
   - Low: The gaze duration for words that are uncommonly appearing in the English Language 
   - Freq Effect: Low words minus High
   - Vocab: Based on an Vocab Comprehension Assessment these scores indicate an individuals vocab ability. The          score ranges from 0 - 40. High scores illustrate an individual with a well defined vocab span.
